Phase gates from PLAN.md §5 and the evidence that each one passed.

| Phase | State | Evidence |

## Phase 0: setup

### The game build we test against

Recorded 2026-10-29 from the install in `~/Drive/SteamLibrary` (Steam, Proton).

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Steam app / build id | 1245620 / 25080141 (installed 2026-10-08) |
| `eldenring.exe` FileVersion | 2.7.1.0 (exe resource) |
| In-game version (title screen) | App Ver. 1.17.2, Calibrations Ver. 1.17.3, with Shadow of the Erdtree |
| Base depot 1245621 | manifest 3886039026718227526 |
| Depot 1245624 | manifest 3497793843869306771 |
| Shadow of the Erdtree, depot 2778580 | manifest 1674424364022381183 (installed, `DLC.bhd/.bdt` present) |
| Oodle | `oo2core_6_win64.dll` |
| `regulation.bin` sha256 | `766521f9508de3a3532df61c45a1c2d93340f1ff7ed8306ab20df761712ca2ab` |

If Steam updates the game, these values change. Make a new stock copy for the new
build and keep the old one, so that tests can say which build they ran against.

### Stock copy

`~/Drive/GameStock/elden-ring/2.7.1.0-build25080141/` holds read-only copies of:

- `Data0`–`Data3` and `DLC` (`.bhd` + `.bdt`);
- `regulation.bin`, `oo2core_6_win64.dll` and `eldenring.exe`.

The sound archives (`sd/`) and movies are left out, since the randomizer never reads them.

- The copies are btrfs reflinks of the install, so they take no extra space. Steam
  rewriting the live files does not change them.
- `SHA256SUMS` in that folder was checked against the live install on
  2026-10-29, and every file matched.
- Re-check the copy with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.

Tools and tests read game files from this folder, never from the live install.
Nothing in it is committed.

### Boot checks

**Unmodded.** Launched from Steam on 2026-10-29 and reached the title screen,
which showed the version above and "OFFLINE".

**Empty me3 attach config.** Launched on 2026-10-29. me3's launcher and host
attached, and the game ran with no errors in the host log.

- me3 runtime v0.13.0 (`me3-launcher.exe`, `me3_mod_host.dll`), the copy the
  Apocrypha desktop app keeps in `~/.local/share/apocrypha/me3-runtime/v0.13.0/`.
  Its hashes match the app's `scripts/me3-runtime.lock`.
- Run through the game's own Proton build (`proton-cachyos-slr`, prefix
  CachyOS-11.0-100) with `proton waitforexitandrun me3-launcher.exe`. The launcher
  is told everything through `ME3_*` environment variables, each value JSON,
  as `apoc-me3/src/launch.rs` does.
- The attach config had no packages and no natives, and redirected the save to
  `apoc-rando-phase0.sl2`, so the real save was not touched. The host log shows
  that redirect taking effect, and no errors.

Two things that cost a failed launch each, worth knowing when we script this:

- The attach config must have every field of me3's `AttachConfig`, including
  an empty `[property_overrides]` table. If one is missing, the launcher exits
  with code 1 and logs nothing after "Parsed launcher args".
- The console file (`ME3_TELEMETRY_MONITOR_PIPE_PATH`) is opened without being
  created, so create it first. If it is missing, the launcher exits with code 1
  and writes no log at all.
